# My Full-Stack Firebase Demo Project

## Introduction

This is a demo project that illustrates the use of Firebase in a full-stack application. The project is built with React for the front end, Node.js for the back end, and Firebase as the database. It showcases user authentication, real-time updates, and various other Firebase features.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Sign-up, log-in, and log-out with Firebase Authentication.
- **Real-time Database**: Storing and retrieving data in real-time using Firebase's Cloud Firestore.
- **File Storage**: Upload and manage files with Firebase Storage.
- **Hosting**: Leverage Firebase Hosting for rapid deployment.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)
- Firebase CLI

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/firebase-demo.git
   cd firebase-demo
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up Firebase:**

   Create a new project in your [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/). Then, navigate to your project settings to find your config object. Replace the configuration in `src/firebaseConfig.js` with your config object.

4. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Deployment

To deploy the project using Firebase Hosting:

1. **Build the project:**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy with Firebase:**
